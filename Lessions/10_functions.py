#4 Defining a function with a if, elif, else statement

#def school_age(age):
   # if age < 5:
   #     print("You are a toddler.")
   # elif age < 13:
   #     print("You are a child.")
   # elif age < 20:
   #     print("You are a teenager.")
   # else:
   #     print("You are an adult.")
#school_age(10)
#input_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
#school_age(input_age)

#5 Defining a function of future value

def Age_predictor(age):
    future_age = age + 10
    return future_age
    print(future_age)
    
Future_predicted_age=Age_predictor(50)
print(Future_predicted_age)
