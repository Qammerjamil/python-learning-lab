#print("This line will execute")  # This is an inline comment

# samentic error
# This is a semantic error example
name = "Qammer Jamil"
print("hello, name")  # This will print "hello, name" instead of "hello, Qammer Jamil"
# This is a semantic error example
# The variable 'name' is not used correctly in the print statement
# now we will fix the semantic error
print("hello ", name)  # This will correctly print "hello, Qammer Jamil"
