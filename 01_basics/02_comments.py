# when to use comments, mentioned 10 study cases
# 1. To explain complex logic
print ("The float number is", 5.5)

# 2. To leave notes for future reference

print("The value of y is", 10)

# 6. To indicate TODOs or improvements

# 7. To mark sections of code
print("The sum of x and y is", 5 + 10)

# 8. To provide context for code changes
print("The difference of x and y is", 10 - 5)

# 9. To explain why certain decisions were made
print("The product of x and y is", 5 * 10)

# 10. To enhance code readability
